Cross-chart crosshair sync: hovering one chart can drive another's crosshair. Adds `price` to the `onCrosshair` event, a controlled `crosshairOverride` prop to mirror a crosshair in data space, and the `setCrosshairData(timeMs, price)` handle / `vroom_chart_set_crosshair_data` core method. The `onCrosshair` `move` event now also fires on vertical (price) moves within a candle so the synced price stays current.
