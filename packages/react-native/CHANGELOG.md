# react-native-vroom-chart

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- 727c79d: Line chart mode with an animated candle↔line transition (web + React Native):

  - **`chartType` prop** (`'candles' | 'line'`) — `'line'` hides the candles and draws
    a polyline through each candle's close. Volume, indicators (RSI/MACD/MAs/VWAP),
    crosshair, and drawings all keep rendering. Style the line with `theme.lineColor`
    and `theme.lineWidth`.
  - **Animated transition** — switching `chartType` smoothly morphs between the two:
    each candle collapses toward its close as the connecting line fades in (and the
    reverse). Control the duration with the new **`transitionMs`** prop (default ~300 ms;
    `0` snaps instantly). Honors `prefers-reduced-motion` on web (a plain cross-fade with
    no vertical motion) and retargets smoothly if toggled mid-transition.

  Both are additive and default to the previous behavior (candlesticks).

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- Candle styling + initial-zoom controls (web + React Native):

  - `defaultCandleWidth` prop — drive the initial zoom from a target candle body width.
  - Candle body border now draws **inside** the body (never changes candle width) and can be hidden.
  - New `setFloat` theme-float bridge, exposing configurable numeric/boolean theme fields:
    - `theme.wickWidth` — wick stroke width (px)
    - `theme.candleRadius` — candle body corner radius (px)
    - `theme.wickRoundCap` — rounded wick end caps
    - `theme.volumeRadius` — rounded top corners on volume bars

  All new styling defaults to off, so existing charts are visually unchanged.

## 0.1.4

### Patch Changes

- c9c78da: Cross-chart crosshair sync: hovering one chart can drive another's crosshair. Adds `price` to the `onCrosshair` event, a controlled `crosshairOverride` prop to mirror a crosshair in data space, and the `setCrosshairData(timeMs, price)` handle / `vroom_chart_set_crosshair_data` core method. The `onCrosshair` `move` event now also fires on vertical (price) moves within a candle so the synced price stays current.

## 0.1.3

### Patch Changes

- 955df2c: Improve chart handling when switching time frames and assets: constant candle width across timeframe changes, full view reset on symbol change, continuous y auto-fit

## 0.1.2

### Patch Changes

- Customizable candle/indicator styling and new web gestures.

  - Per-variant candle border and wick colors (`borderBull`/`borderBear`,
    `wickBull`/`wickBear`) that inherit the body fill when left transparent.
  - Generic `accentBull`/`accentBear` colors for the current-price indicator,
    volume bars, and MACD histogram, decoupled from the candle bull/bear colors.
  - Web: draggable separator to resize the indicator band vs the price pane
    without rescaling candles, and a scalable indicator y-axis (drag the strip
    beside an RSI/MACD pane to zoom its value range independently).

## 0.1.1

### Patch Changes

- x-axis: calendar-aware tick labels (month/year cadences) so labels no longer overlap when zoomed out, and extend the future-scroll cap to 25% candles visible with rubber-band resistance.

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- 5649f45: Initial public release.

  - `react-native-vroom-chart` — Skia candlestick chart for React Native (iOS native + JS), with RSI/MACD/MA/VWAP indicators, theming, crosshair, and pan/zoom/axis gestures.
  - `@vroomchart/core-wasm` — framework-agnostic web core: the C++/Skia renderer compiled to WebAssembly (bundled), with a Canvas2D fallback.
  - `@vroomchart/react` — React DOM `<VroomChart>` over the WASM core, API-matched to the React Native component.
