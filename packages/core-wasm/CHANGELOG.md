# @vroomchart/core-wasm

## 0.7.0

### Minor Changes

- eead2e2: Add consumer-supplied horizontal price status lines, in the style of the order
  and position lines trading terminals draw. Pass `priceLines` to render a line at
  a price with a label group — body text, an optional quantity segment, and an
  optional close button — plus a matching badge in the price axis.

  Lines can be dragged vertically when `draggable` is set: `onPriceLineDrag` fires
  continuously and `onPriceLineDragEnd` fires on drop, and because `priceLines` is
  a controlled prop a host that rejects the move simply doesn't update state and
  the line snaps back. Supplying `onPriceLineClose` renders the close button on
  lines marked `closable`. Escape cancels an in-progress drag on web, where the
  hovered segment also brightens and the cursor becomes `ns-resize`.

  Rendering and hit-testing live in the C++ core, so web and React Native share
  one implementation.

## 0.6.0

### Minor Changes

- 9feb921: Add a Bollinger Bands overlay indicator (`bollingerBands` prop): a basis
  SMA/EMA over a configurable period with upper/lower bands at ± N population
  standard deviations, per-line colors/widths, and an optional translucent fill
  between the bands. Defaults match the standard settings (20-period SMA of close, ±2σ).

## 0.5.0

### Minor Changes

- c2f1d1a: New **box** drawing tool (web) — an axis-aligned rectangle annotation, alongside the
  existing line:

  - **`tool="box"`** — in `draw` mode, click to place one corner and click again to
    commit. A live preview rectangle tracks the cursor between the two clicks; hold
    **Shift** to constrain it to a perfect square.
  - **4 corner anchors** — selecting a box shows a handle on each corner. Dragging one
    resizes the box from that corner while the diagonally opposite corner stays fixed,
    so all four corners always stay at 90°. Shift snaps to a square here too.
  - **Move / edit** — the faint interior fill is grabbable to drag the whole box; delete
    and copy/paste work exactly as they do for lines.
  - **Persistence** — boxes serialize through the same `drawingStore` envelope as lines.
    The `Drawing` type's `type` field widens to `'line' | 'box'`, with `points` holding
    the two opposite corners; `DrawTool` widens to `'line' | 'box'`.

  Additive — existing line drawings and their behavior are unchanged.

- b705ea8: New **pencil** drawing tool (web) — freehand strokes, alongside the existing line
  and box:

  - **`tool="pencil"`** — press and drag to draw for as long as the button is held;
    releasing commits the stroke (`onDrawingComplete`). The tool stays active so you
    can draw several strokes in a row. The path is rendered as a smoothed,
    constant-width stroke with round caps.
  - **Translate-only editing** — a committed stroke is never reshaped. Selecting it
    shows anchors on its first and last point as a visual cue that it can be moved;
    dragging an anchor translates the whole path exactly like dragging any other
    part of it. Delete and copy/paste work as they do for the other tools.
  - **Automatic thinning** — a drag generates hundreds of samples, so strokes are
    simplified before being committed and persisted (typically a few dozen points),
    keeping `drawingStore` payloads reasonable.

  **`Drawing` is now a discriminated union.** `'line'` and `'box'` keep their exact
  `[DrawPoint, DrawPoint]` tuple; `'pencil'` carries a variable-length
  `DrawPoint[]`. Code that reads `points[1]` on a general `Drawing` now needs to
  narrow on `type` first — existing code that already works with a known line or
  box is unaffected. `LineDrawing`, `BoxDrawing` and `PencilDrawing` are exported.

  Persisted payloads are unchanged in shape (no envelope version bump); a build
  without the pencil tool drops unknown strokes on load as before. Deserialization
  now also validates each drawing's `points`, so a corrupt entry from a store is
  dropped instead of reaching the renderer.

### Patch Changes

- a947d48: The web core no longer requires `script-src 'unsafe-eval'`, so it works under a
  strict production CSP. Two independent things needed eval, and both are fixed:

  - **The module loader** used `new Function('u', 'return import(u)')` to hide the
    URL from bundler static analysis. It is now a plain dynamic `import()` carrying
    `/* webpackIgnore: true */` and `/* @vite-ignore */`, which webpack, Turbopack,
    Vite and Rollup all honor (verified: a Vite production build still emits
    `vroom_core.mjs` as a standalone asset rather than inlining it).
  - **The emscripten module itself** — embind and emval generate their JS invoker
    functions with `new Function` at startup, so fixing only the loader would have
    moved the CSP failure into `vroom_core.mjs`. The WASM core is now built with
    `-sDYNAMIC_EXECUTION=0`, selecting emscripten's closure-based invokers. The
    shipped `vroom_core.mjs` contains zero `eval` / `new Function` call sites.

  `script-src 'self' 'wasm-unsafe-eval'` is now sufficient. `'wasm-unsafe-eval'` is
  still required — it is what browsers gate `WebAssembly.instantiate` behind — but
  it does not permit `eval` and is far narrower than `'unsafe-eval'`.

  **New `wasm.importModule` escape hatch** for toolchains that rewrite the import
  anyway, since magic comments only take effect in first-party source:

  ```tsx
  <VroomChart
    wasm={{ importModule: (url) => import(/* webpackIgnore: true */ url) }}
  />
  ```

  `WasmConfig.moduleUrl` is now optional: options other than the URLs layer onto
  the bundled assets, so overriding just the importer no longer means self-hosting
  the core. Passing `moduleUrl` keeps the previous all-or-nothing behavior.

## 0.4.0

### Minor Changes

- 727c79d: Line chart mode with an animated candle↔line transition (web + React Native):

  - **`chartType` prop** (`'candles' | 'line'`) — `'line'` hides the candles and draws
    a polyline through each candle's close. Volume, indicators (RSI/MACD/MAs/VWAP),
    crosshair, and drawings all keep rendering. Style the line with `theme.lineColor`
    and `theme.lineWidth`.
  - **Animated transition** — switching `chartType` smoothly morphs between the two:
    each candle collapses toward its close as the connecting line fades in (and the
    reverse). Control the duration with the new **`transitionMs`** prop (default ~300 ms;
    `0` snaps instantly). Honors `prefers-reduced-motion` on web (a plain cross-fade with
    no vertical motion) and retargets smoothly if toggled mid-transition.

  Both are additive and default to the previous behavior (candlesticks).

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- c09c30f: Line tool editing + managed drawing persistence (web):

  - **Select, edit, and delete lines** — click a line to select it (endpoint handles
    appear), drag a handle to move an endpoint, drag the line body to translate the
    whole line, and press Delete/Backspace to remove a selected line.
  - **Copy / paste** a selected line with Cmd/Ctrl+C / Cmd/Ctrl+V — pasted under the
    crosshair at the same grab point, or above/below the original when the pointer
    hasn't moved.
  - **Shift-constrained drawing** — hold Shift while placing the second point to snap
    the line to the nearest 45°.
  - **Cancel an in-progress line** — Escape/Delete/Backspace after the first point
    cancels it while staying in draw mode.
  - **Managed drawing persistence** — new optional `drawingStore` prop. Provide a
    small string key-value adapter and the chart owns, loads, and saves drawings for
    you (keyed by `seriesKey`, so they persist across timeframes but not markets),
    instead of wiring the controlled `drawings` prop + `onDrawing*` callbacks. The
    stored string is a versioned, migratable envelope owned by the library, so the
    adapter never changes as the drawing schema grows. `serializeDrawings` /
    `deserializeDrawings` helpers are exported for pre-seeding or import/export.

  All additive — the controlled `drawings` model is unchanged. Drawing tools remain
  web-only.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- Candle styling + initial-zoom controls (web + React Native):

  - `defaultCandleWidth` prop — drive the initial zoom from a target candle body width.
  - Candle body border now draws **inside** the body (never changes candle width) and can be hidden.
  - New `setFloat` theme-float bridge, exposing configurable numeric/boolean theme fields:
    - `theme.wickWidth` — wick stroke width (px)
    - `theme.candleRadius` — candle body corner radius (px)
    - `theme.wickRoundCap` — rounded wick end caps
    - `theme.volumeRadius` — rounded top corners on volume bars

  All new styling defaults to off, so existing charts are visually unchanged.

## 0.1.5

### Patch Changes

- cb61128: feat: liquidity bands overlay (order-book depth)

  Render resting-order / L2 liquidity as horizontal price-interval bands behind the
  candles. Each band is anchored at the inner edge of the price axis, stretches left
  and fades out with a gradient, is colored by buy/sell side, and takes its opacity
  from the order volume. Bands are defined in price space so they scale with the
  y-axis. New controlled `liquidity` prop on `<VroomChart>` (`LiquidityConfig` /
  `LiquidityBand`), plumbed through the core (`vroom_chart_set_liquidity`), the WASM
  handle (`setLiquidity`), and React.

## 0.1.4

### Patch Changes

- c9c78da: Cross-chart crosshair sync: hovering one chart can drive another's crosshair. Adds `price` to the `onCrosshair` event, a controlled `crosshairOverride` prop to mirror a crosshair in data space, and the `setCrosshairData(timeMs, price)` handle / `vroom_chart_set_crosshair_data` core method. The `onCrosshair` `move` event now also fires on vertical (price) moves within a candle so the synced price stays current.

## 0.1.3

### Patch Changes

- 955df2c: Improve chart handling when switching time frames and assets: constant candle width across timeframe changes, full view reset on symbol change, continuous y auto-fit

## 0.1.2

### Patch Changes

- Customizable candle/indicator styling and new web gestures.

  - Per-variant candle border and wick colors (`borderBull`/`borderBear`,
    `wickBull`/`wickBear`) that inherit the body fill when left transparent.
  - Generic `accentBull`/`accentBear` colors for the current-price indicator,
    volume bars, and MACD histogram, decoupled from the candle bull/bear colors.
  - Web: draggable separator to resize the indicator band vs the price pane
    without rescaling candles, and a scalable indicator y-axis (drag the strip
    beside an RSI/MACD pane to zoom its value range independently).

## 0.1.1

### Patch Changes

- x-axis: calendar-aware tick labels (month/year cadences) so labels no longer overlap when zoomed out, and extend the future-scroll cap to 25% candles visible with rubber-band resistance.

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- 5649f45: Initial public release.

  - `react-native-vroom-chart` — Skia candlestick chart for React Native (iOS native + JS), with RSI/MACD/MA/VWAP indicators, theming, crosshair, and pan/zoom/axis gestures.
  - `@vroomchart/core-wasm` — framework-agnostic web core: the C++/Skia renderer compiled to WebAssembly (bundled), with a Canvas2D fallback.
  - `@vroomchart/react` — React DOM `<VroomChart>` over the WASM core, API-matched to the React Native component.
